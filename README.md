# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Skills Demonstrated

- Describe JavaScript variables, arrays, data types, and statements.

- Create basic charts, including bar charts and line charts, by using Plotly.

- Use Plotly's layout object to customize the appearance of charts.

- Annotate charts with labels, text, and hover text.
